Projects 
========

I like to spend my free time outside, playing in the mountains, rivers, trails, and skies around Bozeman and SW Montana. As a result, the bulk of what's below are "side proejcts" and publications, work I do as a labor of passion when the weather is bad and I can't play outside.

All of my publications thus far have been in the fisheries field. This makes sense as academically, Iâ€™m a fisheries scientist.

### Publications

* [improvingBioenergeticsModels (in press; 2023)]
* [Quantile regression should replace analysis of relative weight (Wr) for most fisheries analyses (Ranney 2018)](/waeQuantiles)
* [The regression-line percentile method still performs better than the empirical percentile method, even when we take into account additional information (Ranney et al. 2011)](/published/Ranney et al_2011_Ws2.pdf)
* [Standard weight (Ws) equations and relative weight (Wr): Comparing the regression-line percentile and empirical percentile methods for calculating Ws equations (Ranney et al. 2010)](/published/Ranney et al_2010_Ws 1.pdf) 
* [Macroinvertebrate composition in stream lengths affected by Didymospenia geminata, an invasive diatom (James et al. 2010)](/published/James et al_2010_Didymo.pdf)
* [BOR research (2008)]
* [Student reviewers (2008)]
* [Thesis (2008)]

### Software

Although I'm not a software engineer, I do enjoy building reusable tools and through my data science work, I've learned some of the principals of good software development. I also just building things. The Shiny section below helped me explore `R`'s Shiny framework with some extant data, along with webscraping, and some games of chance.

### Shiny apps

Did you know that `R` has a web interface? It's gotten better over the years but here's a few Shiny apps I built many moons ago. Most SHiny apps I've developed in recent years have been Docker-based and deployed to cloud providers. Neat what `R` can do, huh?
