Projects 
========

I like to spend my free time outside, playing in the mountains, rivers, trails, and skies around Bozeman and SW Montana. As a result, the bulk of what's below are "side proejcts" and publications, work I do as a labor of passion when the weather is bad and I can't play outside.

## Publications

All of my publications thus far have been in the fisheries field. This makes sense as academically, Iâ€™m a fisheries scientist.

* [In review: angler satisfaction surveys and Madison River, Montana, fishing pressure](/madison_river_fisheries)
* [Incorporating growth-dependent metabolism into bioenergetics models can improve model accuracy and allow fisheries biologists to make more informed decisions regarding fish growth and energetics. (Ranney et al. 2023)](published/Ranney et al_2023_lmb_respiration.pdf)
* [Quantile regression should replace analysis of relative weight (Wr) for most fisheries analyses (Ranney 2018)](/waeQuantiles)
* [The regression-line percentile method still performs better than the empirical percentile method, even when we take into account additional information (Ranney et al. 2011)](/published/Ranney et al_2011_Ws2.pdf)
* [Standard weight (Ws) equations and relative weight (Wr): Comparing the regression-line percentile and empirical percentile methods for calculating Ws equations (Ranney et al. 2010)](/published/Ranney et al_2010_Ws 1.pdf) 
* [Macroinvertebrate composition in stream lengths affected by Didymospenia geminata, an invasive diatom (James et al. 2010)](/published/James et al_2010_Didymo.pdf)
* [BOR research (2008)](/published/Hayer et al_2008_BF and KH.pdf)
* [Student reviewers (2008)]
* [Thesis (2008)]

## Software

Although I am not a software engineer, I do enjoy building reusable tools and through working as a data scientist, I've learned many of the principals of good software development. I also just enjoy building things. The Shiny section below helped me explore `R`'s Shiny framework with some extant data, along with webscraping, and some games of chance.

* On CRAN: [AnglerCreelSurveySimulation](/AnglerCreelSurveySimulation)
* I serve on the board of a local non-profit and we need to be able to dynamically update our displayed calendar so our constituents could see upcoming events: [Fellowship Hall](/fh)

### Shiny apps

Did you know that `R` has a web interface? It's gotten better over the years but here's a few Shiny apps I built many moons ago. Most Shiny apps I've developed in recent years have been Docker-based and deployed to cloud providers. Neat what `R` can do, huh?
