Hello!

This is my Github home page. Although I have more than a few github repositories, I'm trying out the github pages feature for no other reason other than it's free and I get to write more code and troubleshoot stuff that I think is fun. As a result, there could be some mistakes here but I'm not a professional web developer, so there. 

I may end up trying to shoehorn some `R` pages here just to see how well they work. I think that `*.ipynb` files can be displayed here pretty easily, so I'll poke around there, too.
