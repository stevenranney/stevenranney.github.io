# About

## Steven H. Ranney

I am a classically-trained musician that has an MS in Wildlife and Fisheries Sciences from [South Dakota State University](www.sdstate.edu) and a BS in Biology from [Kennesaw State University](www.kennesaw.edu). I am a creative, quantitative individual that enjoys working with data, programming in Python and `R`, and building and learning new things. I consider myself to be a life-long learner and I like to have an open mind for new experiences, technologies, and opportunities.

In my free time, I enjoy flatpicking guitar and fingerstyle blues, playing with my dogs, hiking, and fishing. In fact, flyfishing for trout in North Georgia is what prompted me to enter the fisheries science field. I wanted to know why I caught fish *here* but not over *there*, on this fly but not that fly. I consumed much of the popular literature on how and where to catch fish and eventually found myself butting my head against the scientific literature. Discussions with friends prompted me to go back to school to study fisheries. It was a great way to combine my passion for being outside (i.e., field work), my normal curiosity, and of course, fishing.

<!-- ## Career Arc

By education and experience, I am a quantitative scientist. Since graduating with my MS in 2008, I have worked as a research assistant at a northern Rocky Mountain university in Montana, as a biometrician with a environmental and statistical consulting firm in Wyoming, I “chose my own adventure” for a while and operated a small environmental, statistical, and data-management firm in SW Montana. Most recently, however, I’ve worked as an analytics consultant for a financial consulting firm. I’ve enjoyed all of the positions I’ve held. Indeed, I learned during my tenure as a biometrician that working with large data sets and discovering new things about those data sets was really what floated my boat. Combining that discovery mentality with my enjoyment of writing code in R and I learned that answering questions with data was really what I enjoyed most.

As an analytics consultant for a financial consulting firm, I manipulate, manage, and analyze data and create visually appealing and easily understood reports from large data sets. In these cases, I generate reports through a Shiny application that allowed others at the firm to access and communicate results to our clients. Much of my work also includes writing custom R packages and F# libraries to allow for the results generated in R and F# to be easily written to formatted Excel spreadsheets. In fact, most recently, I’ve been working in F# exclusively, converting the analyses I wrote in R into an F# webpage that can be accessed without a Shiny license.

I’ve learned that a lot of data analysis is a puzzle. A lot of report creation and generation is a puzzle. *“I have X problem. Steven, will you solve it for me?”* Those kinds of puzzles are fun to solve. I’m looking for more of those now. With data, I can answer a lot of questions.

## The FUTURE!
I’m always looking at what’s out there, mostly for positions where I can use my knowledge of R, my statistical and data analysis experience (including machine learning with SVM, RandomForests, NeuralNetworks, etc), my database skills (MSSQL, MySQL), and my ability to explain technical concepts to non-technical people in a business setting. I recognize this may be a challenge; as a trained fisheries scientist, a lot of people can’t see beyond the degree and the fact that I’m trying to do this remotely is even more of a challenge. But let’s face it: absolutely loving where you live is a hard thing to beat and I absolutely adore SW Montana. Besides, with direct flights from my local airport to Seattle, San Francisco, Salt Lake City, Denver, Houston, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Atlanta, and Newark, I can almost be anywhere in the country within two flights. Also, I enjoy travel, meeting new people, and helping others learn. Further, as I am an established, effective remote worker and with my ability to communicate effectively via telephone, email, technical documents, and with my smiling face on video chat, I’m hoping that the perfect job for me is out there.
