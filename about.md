About
=====

I am a classically-trained musician that has an MS in Wildlife and Fisheries Sciences from [South Dakota State University](www.sdstate.edu) and a BS in Biology from [Kennesaw State University](www.kennesaw.edu). I am a creative, quantitative individual that enjoys working with data, programming in Python and `R`, and building and learning new things. I consider myself to be a life-long learner and I like to have an open mind for new experiences, technologies, and opportunities.

In my free time, I enjoy flatpicking guitar and fingerstyle blues, playing with my dogs, hiking, and fishing. In fact, flyfishing for trout in North Georgia is what prompted me to enter the fisheries science field. I wanted to know why I caught fish *here* but not over *there*, on this fly but not that fly. I consumed much of the popular literature on how and where to catch fish and eventually found myself butting my head against the scientific literature. Discussions with friends prompted me to go back to school to study fisheries. It was a great way to combine my passion for being outside (i.e., field work), my normal curiosity, and of course, fishing.

### Career Arc

By education and experience, I am a quantitative scientist. In reverise chronological order, some of my past jobs have included (but are not limited to):

* Senior data scientist at a big tech company (with which you're *definitely* familiar)
* Director of data science at a patient-focused healthcare firm undergoing a technology reannaissance, building infrastructure as code (IAC)
* Data science consultant for a financial and management consulting firm. 
* Founder of an environmentally-focused startup 
* Biometrician with a environmental and statistical consulting firm
* Research assistant at a northern Rocky Mountain university

I’ve enjoyed all of the positions I’ve held. Indeed, I learned during my tenure as a biometrician that working with large data sets and discovering new things about those data sets was really what floated my boat. Combining that discovery mentality with my enjoyment of writing code, developing new products, and helping people learn new things and I work in a great industry.

Most of data analysis is a puzzle. Building new things is a puzzle. Building new data frameworks and infrastructure is a puzzle. *“I have X problem. Steven, will you solve it for me?”* Those kinds of puzzles are fun to solve. I’m looking for more of those now. With data, I can answer a lot of questions! Heck, even without data, I bet that together, we can get at a pretty good approximation!

<!-- ## The FUTURE!

I’m always looking at what’s out there, mostly for positions where I can use my knowledge of R, my statistical and data analysis experience (including machine learning with SVM, RandomForests, NeuralNetworks, etc), my database skills (MSSQL, MySQL), and my ability to explain technical concepts to non-technical people in a business setting. I recognize this may be a challenge; as a trained fisheries scientist, a lot of people can’t see beyond the degree and the fact that I’m trying to do this remotely is even more of a challenge. But let’s face it: absolutely loving where you live is a hard thing to beat and I absolutely adore SW Montana. Besides, with direct flights from my local airport to Seattle, San Francisco, Salt Lake City, Denver, Houston, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Atlanta, and Newark, I can almost be anywhere in the country within two flights. Also, I enjoy travel, meeting new people, and helping others learn. Further, as I am an established, effective remote worker and with my ability to communicate effectively via telephone, email, technical documents, and with my smiling face on video chat, I’m hoping that the perfect job for me is out there.

Feel free to view my technical resume and don’t hesitate to ask any questions. A more general–and lengthy–CV is available as well. -->
