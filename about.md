# About

 ## Steven H. Ranney

I am a classically-trained musician that has an MS in Wildlife and Fisheries Sciences from [South Dakota State University](www.sdstate.edu) and a BS in Biology from [Kennesaw State University](www.kennesaw.edu). I am a creative, quantitative individual that enjoys working with data, programming in Python and `R`, and building and learning new things. I consider myself to be a life-long learner and I like to have an open mind for new experiences, technologies, and opportunities.

In my free time, I enjoy flatpicking guitar and fingerstyle blues, playing with my dogs, hiking, and fishing. In fact, flyfishing for trout in North Georgia is what prompted me to enter the fisheries science field. I wanted to know why I caught fish *here* but not over *there*, on this fly but not that fly. I consumed much of the popular literature on how and where to catch fish and eventually found myself butting my head against the scientific literature. Discussions with friends prompted me to go back to school to study fisheries. It was a great way to combine my passion for being outside (i.e., field work), my normal curiosity, and of course, fishing.
